This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in VBScript: unexpected comparison results stemming from implicit type conversion.  VBScript's flexibility in handling data types can be a source of subtle bugs if not carefully managed.  The example showcases a comparison between a number and a string, highlighting the potential for unexpected behavior. The solution provides a more robust approach by explicitly converting values to the same type before comparison.
